/**
 * Explanation : 
 * - We know that finalize() method is called by Garbage Collector on an object before destroying it. 
 * - But here, the trick is that the str is String class object, not the Test class. 
 * - Therefore, finalize() method of String class(if overridden in String class) is called on str. 
 * 
 * - If a class doesnâ€™t override finalize method, then by default Object class finalize() method is called.
