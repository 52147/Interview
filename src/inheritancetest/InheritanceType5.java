 * 5. Hybrid Inheritance(Through Interfaces): 
 * 
 * - It is a mix of two or more of the above types of inheritance. 
 * - Since java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances with classes, 
 *   hybrid inheritance is also not possible with classes. 
 *   
 * - In java, we can achieve hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces.
 * 
 * 
 * Java IS-A type of Relationship:
 *
 * - IS-A is a way of saying: 
 * - This object is a type of that object. 
 * - Let us see how the extends keyword is used to achieve inheritance.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * in Object-Oriented terms, the following are true:
 *
 * - SolarSystem the superclass of Earth class.
 * - SolarSystem the superclass of Mars class.
 * - Earth and Mars are subclasses of SolarSystem class.
 * - InheritanceType5 is the subclass of both Earth and SolarSystem classes.
